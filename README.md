1) Getting window seat

A window seat is one of the most favorite seats among the students, the majority of the students are trying to get a windows seat/favorite seat but due to reaching late at the boarding point students can’t find their favorite seat. Usually, students book their seat by keeping their bags’ on the seat, Sometimes students book 2 or more seat for themselves to sit comfortably throughout their journey & due to this other students have to sit congested throughout the journey. To overcome this we are here with an online booking system.

Key features of Online Booking

•       Can book Favourite seat/ Window seat

•       One Seat booking for One ID number which prevents multiple seat booking

•       Get prior notification to the bus manager about no. of the students booked the seat

•       Manager can get an idea about the number of students coming tomorrow so that he can adjust the number of the bus which helps to save fuel.

•       Seat must be book prior to one day of traveling date @7PM


2) Reduces Cost of physical identity card

 A physical identity card is used to

•       Identify the registered students of Travels

•       To verify paid fees

•       To verify the bus route

     

All the above-listed problems are solved by including student's details in the Application, which reduces the cost of identity card (Approx. 8000/sem) & all details like Address, pending fees, contact number are easily accessible from the Profile tab.

M-Booking and its advantages

•       Have you ever gone to your boarding point and realized that there’s no vacant seat for you?

•       Now you did not have to worry about how and where you will get your seat, just because you have booked your favorable seat for that day’s trip?

•       That feeling can be terrible especially if it’s for a return journey too you don’t have to rush and go manually to book seat because you already made your special arrangement by own on your fingertips by M-booking.

• The M-ticket initiative by us can be a game-changer in countless ways. Not only did it put an end to the physical form of an ID CARD but it also ensured that passengers didn’t have to rush back home in case they didn’t have their ID CARD , also have chill pill about seat and also have sorted track record of fee payment.
